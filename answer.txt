First step I found MD5 hash of "hello"
5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592

now I XORed each of the hashes with MD5 hash of hello

6b64756576696168657a766775646465
696c716e676a726879776e66786c7973
346c7176736c75646f657474756272757465

Since this is in hexadecimal I converted it to ascii

kdueviahezvguddeilqngjrhywnfxlys4lqvsludoettubrute

ettubrute are the last words of Julius Caesar, so I decrypted the remaining text using caesar shift with key from 1 to 25

The only meaningful key was this

harbsfxebwsdraabfinkdgoevtkcuivp4inspiral

4 in spiral indicated spiral cipher being used and 4 represented column size

harbsfxebwsdraabfinkdgoevtkcuivp
I wrote this in spiral and I got

HARBKDGSNPOFIVEXFIVEBUTBACKWARDS

FIVE X FIVE BUT BACKWARDS , this hinted in ploybius square or playfair cipher, since there was no key
I went with polybius cipher and since BACKWARDS was mentioned I filled the grid the reverse order

HARBKDGSNPO 

this gave me 
4355245441524423333132 , which when converted to ascii gave me the answer!!
